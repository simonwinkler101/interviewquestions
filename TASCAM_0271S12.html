<span data-start="00:03:28.144" data-end="00:03:34.614"><span title="3:28">You shouldn't hesitate or show uncertainty,</span> <span title="3:32">but if you were too high-handed, she'd make you pay.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:03:35.046" data-end="00:03:39.160"><span title="3:35">She could snake around and have a piece of your arm</span> <span title="3:38">or kick out and crack a shin.</span> </span><br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:57]</small> <span data-start="00:03:57.416" data-end="00:04:01.989"><span title="3:57">But Alice Carneil never hurt Jarrett.</span> <span title="4:01">No horse ever had.</span> </span><br>

<span data-start="00:04:08.885" data-end="00:04:11.019"><span title="4:09">He's half-cult himself.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:04:11.937" data-end="00:04:17.644"><span title="4:12">Jarrett took it as a compliment for what would be the use</span> <span title="4:16">in taking it otherwise.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:04:18.518" data-end="00:04:22.794"><span title="4:19">And it was true he had a feel for horses deep in the grain.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:04:24.104" data-end="00:04:31.094"><span title="4:24">The first bed he could remember was in a horse stall.</span> <span title="4:28">He shared straw with the two geldings in the carriage house,</span> </span><span data-start="00:04:31.504" data-end="00:04:36.828"><span title="4:32">while his mother slept in the mansion,</span> <span title="4:35">nursemaid to the mistress's infant.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:04:38.264" data-end="00:04:45.299"><span title="4:38">Jarrett barely saw her.</span> <span title="4:41">His first language had been the subtle gestures</span> <span title="4:44">and sounds of horses.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:04:46.064" data-end="00:04:51.205"><span title="4:46">He'd been slow to master human speech,</span> <span title="4:49">but he could interpret the horses,</span> </span><span data-start="00:04:51.864" data-end="00:04:57.795"><span title="4:52">their moods, their alliances, their simple wants,</span> <span title="4:57">their many fears.</span> </span><br>

<span data-start="00:05:21.606" data-end="00:05:32.507"><span title="5:22">But at the heart of it, it's a story of this racehorse, Lexington. And I heard that you had overheard the story at a lunch. Is that true?</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:05:32.588" data-end="00:05:38.809"><span title="5:33">Yes, that's right.</span> <span title="5:34">So I'd recently published the novel Caleb's Crossing.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:05:39.203" data-end="00:05:44.483"><span title="5:39">And a lot of the research for that,</span> <span title="5:41">I got help from Plymouth Peltuxet Museum, which</span> </span><span data-start="00:05:44.483" data-end="00:05:50.449"><span title="5:44">is a living history museum about first contact</span> <span title="5:48">with the first English settlers in the Wampanoag.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:05:50.603" data-end="00:05:56.043"><span title="5:51">And they had asked me to come back for a donor's lunch.</span> <span title="5:54">And I thought I was there to be chum in the water,</span> </span><span data-start="00:05:56.043" data-end="00:06:01.243"><span title="5:56">you know, to sit next to somebody with a deep pocket</span> <span title="5:59">and tell them how great the museum was</span> </span><span data-start="00:06:01.243" data-end="00:06:02.908"><span title="6:01">and how helpful it was.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:06:03.003" data-end="00:06:08.462"><span title="6:03">But they'd actually asked me there</span> <span title="6:05">to pitch me another idea for a novel.</span> </span><br>
<span data-start="00:06:08.603" data-end="00:06:12.630"><span title="6:09">And you get a lot of people saying,</span> <span title="6:11">I've got an idea for you.</span> </span><br>
